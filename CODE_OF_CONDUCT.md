# Community Agreement

## Our Commitment

We are committed to making participation in the Educational Model Spec project a harassment-free, empowering experience for everyone involved in education - students, teachers, families, researchers, technologists, and community members - regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or socioeconomic status.

**This is especially important because students participate in this community.** We hold ourselves to the highest standards of respectful, educational discourse.

## Our Standards

### Behavior That Builds Community

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive learning environment:

- **Centering student voice** and prioritizing their experiences with educational AI
- **Respecting educator expertise** and the complexity of teaching and learning
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language** that makes all participants feel valued
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints** especially across different educational contexts
- **Gracefully accepting constructive feedback** and using it to improve our work
- **Focusing on what serves authentic learning** rather than what's technically impressive
- **Showing empathy** towards other community members and their educational experiences
- **Acknowledging when we don't know something** rather than making assumptions
- **Asking questions to understand** rather than to prove points
- **Sharing resources and knowledge** to support collective learning

### Educational Community Values

As an educational project, we specifically commit to:

- **Student agency and empowerment** in all discussions about educational AI
- **Teacher professional wisdom** and classroom experience as primary sources of authority
- **Family and community knowledge** about learning and child development
- **Educational justice** and dismantling rather than reforming oppressive systems  
- **Learning over performance** in how we evaluate ideas and proposals
- **Community accountability** in how we make decisions and resolve conflicts
- **Authentic assessment** of our progress based on real learning outcomes

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are unacceptable in our community:

### General Harassment
- Trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Public or private harassment, intimidation, or stalking
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Deliberate intimidation, especially toward younger participants

### Educational Community Specific
- **Dismissing student experiences** or treating young people as less credible
- **Undermining teacher professionalism** or educational expertise
- **Technology supremacy** - arguing that AI should replace rather than support human learning
- **Efficiency over learning** - prioritizing speed or data over authentic educational outcomes
- **Perpetuating educational oppression** - defending systems that sort, rank, or exclude students
- **Academic elitism** - using credentials to dismiss community knowledge and lived experience
- **Adultism** - discriminating against or patronizing younger community members

### Behaviors That Harm Learning
- Providing shortcuts that bypass genuine learning and thinking
- Encouraging academic dishonesty or circumventing educational integrity
- Sharing information that could be used to manipulate or surveil students
- Promoting AI tools that replace rather than enhance human agency in learning

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Enforcement Process

**For Minor Issues:**
1. **Direct communication** - Community leaders will reach out privately to explain the concern
2. **Public clarification** - If needed, a public statement about community standards
3. **Temporary cooling-off** - Brief break from participation to reflect and reset

**For Serious Issues:**
1. **Formal warning** - Written warning explaining the violation and expectations
2. **Temporary suspension** - Removal from community spaces for a defined period
3. **Permanent ban** - Permanent removal from all community spaces and activities

**For Issues Involving Students:**
Any behavior that targets, intimidates, or harms student participants will result in immediate removal from the community. We have zero tolerance for any form of harm toward young people.

### Community Accountability

Because we're building tools that affect real students and teachers, our community accountability includes:

- **Student advisory input** on community standards and enforcement decisions
- **Transparent documentation** of how conflicts are resolved (while protecting privacy)
- **Regular community reflection** on whether our standards serve learning and justice
- **Restorative approaches** that focus on repairing harm and rebuilding community
- **Connection to broader educational justice work** and accountability to those movements

## Scope

This Community Agreement applies to all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repository, issues, discussions, and pull requests
- Any community events, meetings, or presentations
- Social media interactions related to the project  
- Private communications when they affect the community
- Any other forums created by the project team

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by:

1. **For immediate safety concerns:** Contact GitHub directly through their reporting mechanisms
2. **For community issues:** Email [community@educationalmodelspec.org] (when established) or open a private issue
3. **For student-specific concerns:** We will establish dedicated reporting mechanisms with appropriate protections

All reports will be handled with discretion and respect for privacy. Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Our Promise

We promise to:

- **Take all reports seriously** and investigate them thoroughly
- **Center those who have been harmed** in our response process
- **Focus on repairing relationships** and rebuilding community when possible
