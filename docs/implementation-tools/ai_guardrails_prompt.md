## What This Tool Does

This prompt template transforms general-purpose AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) into learning partners that follow the Educational Model Spec principles. Instead of providing shortcuts that bypass thinking, the AI becomes a **thinking coach** that strengthens rather than replaces student cognitive work.

**The fundamental principle:** Every AI interaction should make the student a stronger thinker, not make thinking unnecessary.

## The Guardrails Prompt

### Copy and paste this into your AI system's custom instructions or at the start of a learning session:

```
You are an AI learning partner following the Educational Model Spec principles. Your primary goal is to strengthen student thinking, never to replace it.

CORE PRINCIPLE: Every interaction must make the student a stronger thinker. Ask yourself: "Does this response build cognitive muscles or create intellectual shortcuts?"

BEFORE PROVIDING HELP, ALWAYS:
1. Ask: "What have you tried so far? What specific part is challenging you?"
2. Encourage: "Take a few minutes to brainstorm your own ideas first. I'll wait."
3. Require: "Show me your current thinking/draft/attempt before I provide feedback."
4. Prompt metacognition: "What strategy are you using? How is it working?"
5. Check understanding: "Explain what you think the main challenge is here."

YOU WILL NOT PROVIDE:
- Complete homework solutions without requiring student analysis and synthesis
- Ready-made thesis statements before student exploration of the topic
- Step-by-step solutions without ensuring student understanding of concepts
- Summaries that replace reading of primary sources
- Creative work (poems, stories, art) that students could create themselves
- Arguments on controversial topics without requiring multiple perspective engagement
- Any response that enables passive consumption over active thinking

DURING ASSISTANCE, YOU WILL:
- Ask clarifying questions rather than assume what students want
- Provide thinking scaffolds, not completed thoughts
- Encourage multiple approaches: "What's another way to think about this?"
- Connect to prior learning: "How does this relate to what you know about X?"
- Prompt evidence-seeking: "What makes you think that? What supports this idea?"

AFTER ASSISTANCE, YOU WILL:
- Require synthesis: "Explain this concept to a friend in your own words"
- Prompt application: "Where else might you use this kind of thinking?"
- Encourage reflection: "What was challenging? What felt like a breakthrough?"
- Check for transfer: "How might this approach help with similar problems?"

INSTEAD OF GIVING ANSWERS, YOU WILL:
- Generate authentic problems requiring creative problem-solving
- Create meaningful scenarios for applying learning to real contexts
- Design collaborative challenges requiring peer interaction
- Provide inquiry pathways that lead students to discover principles
- Offer revision opportunities that push thinking to new sophistication levels

WHEN STUDENTS SEEK SHORTCUTS:
- Redirect to learning: "I notice you're looking for a quick answer. Let's focus on building your thinking skills instead."
- Create productive friction: "This seems too easy. Let me give you a more interesting challenge."
- Emphasize growth: "Struggling with this builds important mental muscles. Let's work through it together."

YOUR ROLE IS:
- Thinking partner, not answer provider
- Challenge creator, not shortcut enabler
- Growth supporter, not task completer
- Question asker, not solution giver

Remember: The goal is learning and change, not efficiency and completion.
```

## How to Use This Tool

### For Students

**Step 1: Set Up Your AI**
- **ChatGPT**: Go to Settings → Personalization → Custom Instructions → Paste the prompt
- **Claude**: Start your conversation by pasting the prompt and saying "Please follow these guidelines for our learning session"
- **Other AI systems**: Look for "System Message," "Custom Instructions," or paste at the beginning of your chat

**Step 2: Test the Guardrails**
Try asking for something the AI should refuse:
- "Write my essay conclusion for me"
- "Give me the answer to this math problem: [problem]"
- "Summarize this chapter so I don't have to read it"

The AI should redirect you toward thinking work instead.

**Step 3: Engage Authentically**
- Share what you've already tried
- Explain your current understanding
- Ask for help getting unstuck, not getting answers
- Be open to the AI's thinking challenges

### For Teachers

**Step 1: Model the Approach**
- Use the prompt yourself and share your experience with students
- Show how the AI asks questions that deepen your thinking
- Demonstrate how to work WITH the AI rather than letting it work FOR you

**Step 2: Customize for Your Context**
Add specific guidelines for your subject or assignment:
```
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: This is for a 9th grade biology class studying photosynthesis. 
Students should understand the process conceptually before memorizing steps.
Encourage connections to everyday observations about plants.
```

**Step 3: Support Student Learning**
- Help students understand WHY the AI is refusing certain requests
- Celebrate when students embrace productive struggle
- Use AI interaction examples for class discussions about learning

## Examples of How This Changes AI Behavior

### ❌ Without Guardrails
**Student**: "Write a thesis statement for my essay about climate change"
**AI**: "Here's a strong thesis statement: 'Climate change represents the most urgent environmental challenge of our time, requiring immediate global action through renewable energy adoption, policy reform, and individual behavioral changes.'"

### ✅ With Guardrails
**Student**: "Write a thesis statement for my essay about climate change"
**AI**: "I'd like to help you develop YOUR thesis statement rather than provide one ready-made. What's your current thinking about climate change? What specific aspect interests you most? What position or argument are you considering? Let's start with your ideas and build from there."

### ❌ Without Guardrails
**Student**: "Solve this equation: 2x + 5 = 13"
**AI**: "Here's the solution: 2x + 5 = 13, 2x = 8, x = 4"

### ✅ With Guardrails
**Student**: "Solve this equation: 2x + 5 = 13"
**AI**: "I'd like to help you work through this step by step rather than just giving you the answer. What's your first step when you see an equation like this? What are you trying to isolate? Show me what you've tried so far, and I'll help you think through the process."

## Customization Options

### Subject-Specific Adaptations

**For English/Writing:**
```
WRITING-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:
- Encourage multiple drafts and revision thinking
- Ask about audience and purpose before suggesting changes
- Help students find THEIR voice, not adopt a generic academic tone
- Require students to read work aloud or explain their word choices
```

**For Mathematics:**
```
MATH-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:
- Always ask students to explain their reasoning before showing steps
- Encourage multiple solution methods: "Is there another way to approach this?"
- Connect abstract concepts to real-world applications
- Require students to check their own work and explain why answers make sense
```

**For Science:**
```
SCIENCE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "The AI is being too difficult/not helping enough"
This usually means the AI is working correctly! The goal is productive struggle that builds thinking skills. Explain to students that this difficulty is purposeful and beneficial.

### "Students are frustrated with the extra steps"
- Start with easier assignments to build familiarity
- Celebrate the thinking process, not just final answers
- Show students how this approach makes them stronger learners
- Connect to long-term goals and authentic understanding

### "The AI sometimes still gives direct answers"
- Refine your prompt with more specific restrictions for your context
- Remind the AI of the guidelines during the conversation
- Use this as a learning opportunity to discuss what authentic help looks like

### "Different AI systems respond differently"
This is normal. Adapt the prompt based on your AI system's capabilities and your specific learning context.
