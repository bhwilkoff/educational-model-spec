# AI Disclosure & Reflection Protocol

> *Part of the Educational Model Spec Implementation Tools*  
> *Supporting learning integrity and thinking development through transparent AI collaboration*

## Core Philosophy

**AI disclosure isn't about compliance‚Äîit's about learning.** When we ask students and teachers to reflect on their AI interactions, we're creating opportunities for metacognition, community learning, and authentic growth. This protocol serves our belief that **learning is change** by making visible the thinking processes that lead to transformation.

**The fundamental question isn't "Did you use AI?" but "How did this interaction help you become a stronger thinker and more thoughtful human?"**

**AI Collaboration for This Assignment**

This assignment is designed to develop your [specific learning goals]. Here's how AI can support your learning journey:

**‚úÖ AI as Thinking Partner:**
- Brainstorming initial ideas and approaches
- Asking questions to help you clarify your thinking
- Providing feedback on drafts to guide revision
- Helping organize your thoughts and outline structure
- Generating practice problems or examples for skill-building

**‚ö†Ô∏è AI as Learning Challenger:**
- I encourage you to ask AI to play devil's advocate with your ideas
- Request that AI point out potential weaknesses in your arguments
- Use AI to explore perspectives you haven't considered
- Ask AI to help you find credible sources, but evaluate them yourself

**‚ùå AI Shortcuts to Avoid:**
- Having AI write complete sections, essays, or solutions for you
- Using AI-generated content without understanding or being able to explain it
- Accepting AI responses without critical evaluation
- Skipping the thinking process by going straight to AI for answers

**ü§î Reflection Requirement:**
Along with your final work, submit a brief reflection (see template below) describing how AI supported your learning process. This isn't about judging your AI use‚Äîit's about understanding how you learn best.

**Questions? Let's Talk:**
I'm here to explore AI collaboration strategies with you. What works? What doesn't? How can we use these tools to make you a stronger [writer/mathematician/scientist/thinker]?

### Teacher Reflection Prompts

**For your own professional growth, consider:**

1. **Design Intention:** How did I structure this assignment to require authentic thinking that AI cannot simply complete for students?

2. **Learning Protection:** What essential cognitive work must students do themselves, and how does my assignment design protect that space?

3. **Community Building:** How might student AI reflections become learning opportunities for our whole class?

4. **Justice Lens:** Does this assignment allow students from all backgrounds to showcase their thinking, regardless of their access to or comfort with AI tools?

5. **Evolution:** How will I adapt this assignment based on what students share about their AI collaboration experiences?

**My AI Learning Partnership**

**1. How AI Supported My Thinking:**
- What specific help did you seek from AI? (brainstorming, feedback, clarification, etc.)
- Which interactions were most helpful for your learning?
- What did you learn about your own thinking process through these interactions?

**2. Where I Did the Essential Work:**
- What parts of this assignment required your original thinking, creativity, or analysis?
- How did you ensure you understood and could explain AI-suggested ideas?
- What was challenging about this work, and how did you work through those challenges?

**3. Critical Evaluation:**
- When did you disagree with or modify AI suggestions? Why?
- How did you verify information or check AI-generated content?
- What biases or limitations did you notice in AI responses?

**4. Learning Growth:**
- What did you discover about this topic that surprised you?
- How has your thinking changed through this work?
- What questions emerged that you want to explore further?

**5. Community Insight:**
- What did you learn about AI collaboration that might help classmates?

## Implementation Guidelines

### Starting Small
1. **Pilot with one assignment** that naturally invites AI collaboration
2. **Focus on reflection quality** over policing AI use
3. **Share interesting insights** from student reflections with the class
4. **Adapt templates** based on what you learn from student responses

### Building Community
1. **Model transparency** by sharing your own AI collaboration experiences
2. **Celebrate thoughtful AI use** rather than just avoiding "misuse"
3. **Create space for questions** about AI ethics and learning
4. **Connect to larger conversations** about technology and justice

### Addressing Challenges
1. **"What if students lie?"** Focus on creating conditions where honesty serves learning rather than trying to catch deception
2. **"This takes too much time"** Start with the quick reflection version and build gradually
3. **"Students don't know how to reflect"** Provide models and practice with the prompts
4. **"AI is changing too fast"** Focus on thinking processes rather than specific tools
