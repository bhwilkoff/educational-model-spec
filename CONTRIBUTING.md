# Contributing to Educational Model Spec

Thank you for your interest in building AI that truly serves learning! This specification is designed BY the communities most impacted by educational AI FOR authentic learning that serves human flourishing.

## 🌟 Our Approach

**We believe those closest to educational challenges should lead the solutions.** This means:

- **Student voice is primary** - If you're a student, your experience and perspective are essential
- **Teacher wisdom is irreplaceable** - Educators understand learning in ways technologists often miss  
- **Community accountability matters** - Families and communities must have real power in AI decisions
- **Justice work is central** - We're dismantling oppressive systems, not just improving them
