# Contributing to Educational Model Spec

Thank you for your interest in building AI that truly serves learning! This specification is designed BY the communities most impacted by educational AI FOR authentic learning that serves human flourishing.

## üåü Our Approach

**We believe those closest to educational challenges should lead the solutions.** This means:

- **Student voice is primary** - If you're a student, your experience and perspective are essential
- **Teacher wisdom is irreplaceable** - Educators understand learning in ways technologists often miss  
- **Community accountability matters** - Families and communities must have real power in AI decisions
- **Justice work is central** - We're dismantling oppressive systems, not just improving them

## ü§ù Ways to Contribute

### üí¨ Join Discussions
Share your experiences, ask questions, and help shape the specification:
- [üí° Ideas & Proposals](../../discussions/categories/ideas-and-proposals) - Suggest new concepts or approaches
- [üè´ Implementation Stories](../../discussions/categories/implementation-stories) - Share what's working (or not) in real classrooms
- [ü§î Q&A](../../discussions/categories/q-a) - Ask questions about any aspect of the project
- [üìä Research & Evidence](../../discussions/categories/research-and-evidence) - Share relevant studies and data
- [‚öñÔ∏è Justice & Equity](../../discussions/categories/justice-and-equity) - Discuss how to better serve marginalized communities
- [üí¨ General](../../discussions) - Open-ended conversations about the specification

### üìù Suggest Changes
- **Small improvements:** Comment directly on specific sections with suggestions
- **Larger changes:** [Open an issue](../../issues/new) to discuss before submitting a pull request
- **New sections or tools:** Propose additions through discussions first to gather community input

### üîç Specification Evolution
**This specification functions as living code that evolves through community input.**

**Proposing Amendments:**
- Reference specific clause IDs (EMS-XXX-##) when suggesting changes
- Provide evidence for why changes would better serve learning
- Include proposed success criteria for measuring improvement
- Test proposed changes with real community members before formal submission

**Community Review Process:**
1. **Discussion Phase**: Propose changes in [Ideas & Proposals](../../discussions/categories/ideas-and-proposals) with specific clause references
2. **Community Testing**: Trial proposed changes in pilot implementations
3. **Evidence Gathering**: Document outcomes and community feedback
4. **Formal Proposal**: Submit pull request with community support and evidence
5. **Democratic Decision**: Community review and collaborative refinement

**Specification Debugging:**
- Report when AI behavior violates specific clauses (use clause IDs like EMS-AGR-02a)
- Identify ambiguous language that allows multiple interpretations
- Suggest clarifications that maintain democratic values while improving clarity
- Test whether "fixes" actually serve marginalized communities better

### üõ†Ô∏è Test Implementation Tools
We've developed practical tools to support implementation. Try them out and share feedback:
- [AI Disclosure & Reflection Protocol](docs/implementation-tools/ai-disclosure-protocol.md) - Test transparent AI collaboration practices
- [Thinking Engagement Rubrics](docs/implementation-tools/thinking-engagement-rubrics.md) - Distinguish between AI shortcuts and productive thinking
- Share your experience using these tools in [Implementation Stories](../../discussions/categories/implementation-stories)

### üîç Review & Feedback
- Review proposed changes and provide thoughtful feedback
- Test ideas in your educational context and report back
- Help ensure changes align with our core principles
- **Evaluate spec compliance**: Use clause IDs to assess whether implementations follow stated principles

### üß™ Specification Compliance Testing
**Help ensure the specification actually works in practice:**

**Community Auditing:**
- Test AI systems against specific clauses (reference EMS-XXX-## IDs)
- Document when AI behavior violates specification principles
- Evaluate whether implementations serve stated success criteria
- Report findings in [Implementation Stories](../../discussions/categories/implementation-stories)

**Systematic Evaluation:**
- Use our Spec Compliance Testing Framework to audit AI tools
- Participate in community review of specification adherence
- Help identify gaps between specification intent and implementation reality
- Contribute to "debugging" the specification when it doesn't serve communities

**Evidence Gathering:**
- Document outcomes when specification principles are followed vs. ignored
- Share data about whether changes actually benefit marginalized communities
- Measure success using community-defined criteria, not institutional metrics
- Build case studies of effective specification implementation

### üåç Expand Access
- Translate materials into other languages
- Adapt examples for different cultural contexts  
- Share with educational communities who should be part of this conversation

## üìã Contribution Process

### 1. **Start with Discussion**
Before making significant changes, start a discussion to:
- Get community input on your ideas using specific clause references (EMS-XXX-##)
- Ensure alignment with our principles through community testing
- Build support for substantial modifications with evidence
- Learn from others' experiences implementing similar changes

### 2. **Small Changes**
For typos, clarifications, or minor improvements:
- Fork the repository
- Make your changes with clear references to affected clauses
- Submit a pull request with a clear description
- Respond to feedback from reviewers

### 3. **Large Changes**
For new sections, major revisions, or structural changes:
- Start with a discussion or issue to gather input using clause IDs
- Draft your proposal with community feedback and success criteria
- Test proposed changes in real educational contexts
- Submit pull request only after community discussion and evidence gathering
- Be prepared for multiple rounds of feedback and revision

### 4. **Specification Standards**
All contributions will be evaluated based on:
- **Alignment with core principles** - Does this serve authentic learning over efficiency?
- **Community input** - Have impacted stakeholders been heard and centered?
- **Evidence and experience** - Is this grounded in real educational contexts?
- **Accessibility** - Can diverse communities understand and use this?
- **Implementation feasibility** - Can this actually be built and sustained?
- **Justice impact** - Does this dismantle rather than reform oppressive systems?
- **Measurable outcomes** - Are success criteria clear and community-defined?

### 5. **Specification Compliance**
Changes must demonstrate that they:
- Can be implemented using existing clause IDs or propose new ones
- Include clear success criteria for measuring effectiveness
- Have been tested with marginalized communities, not just privileged ones
- Actually serve learning rather than institutional convenience
- Maintain democratic governance and community accountability

- AI that replaces human relationships in learning
- Technology that primarily serves efficiency over learning
- Solutions designed by technologists without educator and student input
- Approaches that maintain rather than challenge oppressive educational systems
