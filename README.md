# Educational Model Spec

> *An open-source, democratically-developed specification for AI in education that prioritizes human learning, teacher empowerment, and student agency over test outcomes.*

## 🎯 Our Vision

**Learning is change.** Not the accumulation of facts for regurgitation, not the performance of understanding for external validation, but the authentic transformation that occurs when humans engage with ideas, with each other, and with the world around them.

This specification is designed BY educators, students, families, and communities FOR authentic learning that serves human flourishing rather than algorithmic efficiency.

## 📚 Quick Start

- 🌟 **[Read the Full Specification](docs/overview.md)** - Our complete framework for learning-centered AI
- 💬 **[Join the Discussion](../../discussions)** - Share your thoughts and experiences
- 🤝 **[How to Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Add your voice to this living document
- 📋 **[Community Agreement](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** - Our commitment to safe, inclusive collaboration

## 🎓 What Makes This Different

Unlike AI specifications designed by tech companies, this model spec:

- **Puts students first** - AI serves learning, not surveillance or efficiency
- **Empowers teachers** - Technology amplifies educator wisdom rather than replacing it  
- **Dismantles oppression** - Actively interrupts systems that sort and rank students
- **Protects agency** - Students own their learning data and educational narrative
- **Engages thinking** - AI creates cognitive challenges rather than shortcuts
- **Builds community** - Learning happens through authentic relationships

## 🏗️ Framework Overview

### 1. [Foundational Learning Philosophy](docs/overview.md#1-foundational-learning-philosophy)
Learning as process, multiple paths to wisdom, creation over consumption

### 2. [Democratic Governance](docs/overview.md#2-democratic-governance--stakeholder-input)  
Student voice as primary, community accountability, transparent decision-making

### 3. [Human-Centered Design](docs/overview.md#3-human-centered-learning-design)
AI as facilitator never replacement, protecting human agency, teacher empowerment

### 4. [Assessment Philosophy](docs/overview.md#4-assessment-philosophy--practice)
Evidence of growth over test scores, formative feedback, authentic purposes

### 5. [AI Guardrails](docs/overview.md#5-ai-guardrails-engaging-vs-subverting-thinking)
Engaging thinking never replacing it, critical thinking checkpoints, academic integrity

### 6. [Student Data Ownership](docs/overview.md#6-student-ownership-of-learning-data--meaningful-portfolios)
Meaningful portfolios, complete student control, post-secondary transformation

### 7. [Privacy & Safety](docs/overview.md#7-privacy-safety--well-being)
Data as sacred trust, emotional safety, supporting growth mindset

### 8. [Dismantling Oppression](docs/overview.md#8-dismantling-systems-of-oppression-through-educational-ai)
Beyond diversity theater, educational justice, community accountability
